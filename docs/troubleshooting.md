# Troubleshooting

Something broke — or rather, something *revealed itself*, because it was always broken. You merely summoned it into the light.

## Installing Helm and Helmfile

helmfile2compose needs `helm` and `helmfile` to render manifests. Yes, you need the thing you're trying to escape from. The irony is not lost on anyone.

!!! tip "Package manager"
    Some package managers already have both: `brew install helm helmfile` on macOS, `pacman -S helm helmfile` on Arch. If that works, skip the manual install below.

    Debian/Ubuntu don't package them — install manually:

**Helm:**

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```

Auto-detects OS/arch, downloads, verifies checksum, installs to `/usr/local/bin`. Verify: `helm version` should print v3.x.

**Helmfile:**

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile/releases/download/v1.3.0/helmfile_1.3.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar -xzf - helmfile
sudo mv helmfile /usr/local/bin/
```

Verify: `helmfile --version` should print v1.x. Other platforms: check the [release assets](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile/releases/latest) for your OS/arch.

## nerdctl compose does not work

nerdctl compose silently ignores `networks.*.aliases` — the key that makes K8s FQDNs resolve in compose. Without it, every service that references another by its K8s DNS name (`svc.ns.svc.cluster.local`) will fail to connect.

**The fix**: install the [`flatten-internal-urls`](https://docs.dekube.io/catalogue/#flatten-internal-urls) transform. It strips all network aliases and rewrites FQDNs to short compose service names, which nerdctl resolves natively. No runtime change needed.

```bash
python3 dekube-manager.py flatten-internal-urls
```

If you are running Rancher Desktop with containerd: switching to dockerd (moby) in Rancher Desktop settings avoids the problem entirely — one checkbox, one VM restart. See [Limitations — Network aliases](https://docs.dekube.io/limitations/#network-aliases-nerdctl) for the full list of workarounds and caveats (including cert-manager compatibility).

## Chart-specific issues

If the issue is specific to a Helm chart rather than helmfile2compose itself — a sidecar that needs the K8s API, a container that expects a CRD controller at runtime, an image that phones home to the apiserver on startup — check the [known workarounds](known-workarounds/index.md). Those are sushi recipes for tentacles that don't fit, organized by chart.

If the chart *genuinely needs a kube-apiserver at runtime* (leader election, service discovery via API, k8s-sidecar watchers), the [fake-apiserver](https://docs.dekube.io/catalogue/#fake-apiserver) extension can provide one — a fake one, backed by a Python script, self-signed certs, and questionable life choices. Install it, and the problem goes away. Whether it's replaced by a worse problem is a matter of perspective.

## Network alias collisions (multi-project)

Your stack works half the time and breaks the other half? Services resolve to the wrong container? One request succeeds, the next returns someone else's login page?

When multiple helmfile2compose projects share the same Docker network (`network: shared-infra` in `dekube.yaml`), every network alias from every service in every project lands on the same DNS namespace. Every FQDN, every short name, every cursed `.svc.cluster.local` suffix — all of them, cohabiting in a flat network.

The **FQDNs** are mostly safe — K8s namespaces are baked into the names, so `redis.stoatchat-redis.svc.cluster.local` and `redis.lasuite-redis.svc.cluster.local` resolve to different containers.

The **short aliases** do not. When a K8s Service name differs from its compose service name (e.g. `keycloak-service` → compose service `keycloak`), the K8s name is added as a short alias. If two projects register the same short alias on the same network, Docker resolves it via round-robin between both containers. Silent. Random.

**How to diagnose:** inspect the network aliases on your running containers:

```bash
docker inspect <container> --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.Networks }}'
```

If two containers from different projects share the same alias on the same network, you found it. See [Advanced — multi-project](advanced.md) for the setup that avoids this.
