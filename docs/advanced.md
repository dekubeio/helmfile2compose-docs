# Advanced usage

## Cohabiting with existing infrastructure

Your server already has compose projects running, maybe its own reverse proxy, and you want to drop a helmfile2compose-generated stack into the mix. This is possible, inadvisable, and documented here for the brave.

### The problem

By default, helmfile2compose generates a Caddy service claiming ports 80 and 443. If anything else on the host already binds those ports, it won't start.

### The solution

1. Disable Caddy generation. In `dekube.yaml`, add:

```yaml
disable_ingress: true
```

This skips the Caddy service in `compose.yml` and writes the Ingress rules to `Caddyfile-<project>` instead of `Caddyfile`. Note: any previously generated `Caddyfile` is **not** automatically deleted — remove it manually if present.

2. Configure your reverse proxy.

   The default reverse proxy is **Caddy**, bundled with the distribution. But the system is pluggable — three options depending on your situation:

   - **If you already use Caddy** — you're in luck. Merge the contents of `Caddyfile-<project>` into your existing Caddyfile. When the project regenerates, diff the new fragment against your merged version and update accordingly. This will break on upgrades. At some point, actions have consequences.

   - **If you use something else** (nginx, Traefik, HAProxy, ...) — the `Caddyfile-<project>` is still generated as a reference for which hosts and paths map to which upstream services. Translate it to your proxy's config format manually. If you'd rather have helmfile2compose generate your proxy's config natively, you can install an [ingress provider extension](https://docs.dekube.io/catalogue/#ingress-providers) if one exists for your proxy, or [write your own](https://docs.dekube.io/extensions/writing-ingressproviders/).

   - **If you don't need a reverse proxy at all** — `disable_ingress: true` skips both the proxy service and the config file. Services are still reachable directly by their exposed ports. This is the simplest option for local dev when you don't care about host-based routing.

3. Your existing compose projects and the helmfile2compose-generated one must share a Docker network so the reverse proxy can reach every service. In `dekube.yaml`, add:

```yaml
network: shared-infra
```

This overrides the default compose network with an external one. Create it once with `docker network create shared-infra` and reference the same network in your other compose files. Host port collisions from services that bind directly (livekit UDP ranges, game servers, etc.) are your problem — disable or exclude duplicates.

Note: the `generate-compose.sh` scripts shipped with stoatchat-platform and lasuite-platform check for drift between expected and actual output. Adding `disable_ingress` and `network` to `dekube.yaml` will trigger drift warnings on every run. This is expected — and deserved.


### Multiple helmfile2compose projects

Good news: running two (or more) helmfile2compose-generated stacks on the same host is no harder than running one alongside existing infrastructure. Apply the same recipe to each project — `disable_ingress: true`, same `network:`, merge the `Caddyfile-*` fragments — and you're done. Each project gets its own `compose.yml` and its own `dekube.yaml`, completely independent. The desecration scales linearly.

Watch out for **collisions**: host port conflicts (two projects binding the same port — only one wins, exclude the duplicate) and network alias conflicts (short aliases coexist on the same DNS namespace — FQDNs are safe, but short names can round-robin between projects). If something works half the time and breaks the other half, see [Troubleshooting — network alias collisions](https://docs.dekube.io/troubleshooting/#network-alias-collisions-multi-project).

### Do NOT use `docker compose -p`

If the project has sidecar containers, `docker compose -p` will break them.

Sidecars use `container_name` and `network_mode: container:<name>` to share their parent's network namespace. The container name is derived from the project name in `dekube.yaml`. When you override the project name with `-p`, compose generates different container names but the `network_mode` references still point to the original names. The sidecar can't find its parent, and everything fails.

To rename a project: edit `name:` in `dekube.yaml`, delete `compose.yml`, regenerate.

If you want to use `docker compose -p` because it's convenient and you don't need to take everything down and yadda yadda yadda — next time use Kubernetes instead of summoning eldritch horrors, that will indeed be more convenient.

### What this looks like in practice

```
~/my-platform/
  compose.yml              <- no caddy service, external network
  Caddyfile-my-platform    <- ingress rules fragment
  dekube.yaml              <- disable_ingress: true, network: shared-infra

~/other-stuff/             <- your existing compose projects
  compose.yml              <- same external network
  ...

~/reverse-proxy/           <- you manage this (or your existing one)
  Caddyfile                <- includes rules from Caddyfile-my-platform
```
